Recently, this issues let amount of people awaring it, shocked by this traditional type but refreshing and dramatic contents, specially university students and individuals own similar backgrounds or past experience.

As the limited thoughts and fixed concepts in pubilc views, people always concieve the things happened that a male professor invading the rights of female university students as the similar happening surrouding their ears again and again. Same as other sexual scandal, soon it was widely spread. While this things changed a lot, playing by two characters in same gender, not as regularly happened. Therefore, it was promoting scandal spreading when individuals read it, arousing them interests, and then deliver to the next readers rapidly.

I had read a lot comments and narrations someone who talking about this scandal, most people were disputing about it between supporting "pity professor" and "unethical" student basically. Therefore, i don't want to waste time to repeat same views on it. 

Overall, my views are surrounding with the points ignored by people.
- Victims of neglect
- Rights that are not protected

Firstly, i seem that too many people and views focusing on victims they caring about, either the former or the latter. Whether the other victims are existing, excluded and ignored from main horizon. The dramatic and painful things are who purchase the cost, if it only one man violating the rights of another? I don't think that's the case, while it really that a case of an elderly teacher who sincerely give love and a young student who lets him down? Otherwise, the superiors use their power to violates the rights of students who are in a lower position. While i just saw the ugliness of the sex transfer scandal, neither only a case of who give love, nor a simple case of who violate another merely. For the case 1, what's even more pitiful is the dad's sons with broken famaliy and possibly unaware wife. Moreover, the other students in the lab, who struggling for operating experiments and writing pappers, but the results were stolen by others. The most vulnerable and sad heart, when they saw the scandal, someone violates thier rights in graduate examination selection, through an unfair and ilegal "helping hand" by the professor in order to satisfy selfish desires, that are pity. Even more pity things are some invisbale victims still unwaring, justice will not come, futhermore, not many people care about their rights they deserved and feelings, constantly focusing teacher and student, zooming about narratives of internets comments for the two. One more sentence, as said that the successful guidelines of how to writing a good story for people, there are some simple ways to attract and envoke audiences, you should tell the reason of failure casued by other people to populations, and tell the success they built not other factor working to the success people. But sometimes I want to say that the truth is not like this. Pitiful struggling and hard-working students in cases may concieve that the failure of competing caused by not enough working hard. They keep looking for reasons for their failure in their subsequent life, making up a plausible excuse for themselves, the truth is actually not. However they don't have chances to get justice for themselves, and population don't have opportunities to hear their voices. As a person without privilege, who is not in such a tragedy?

Other, the professor don't have chances to protect his rights. In most views, the bad person they are evilly and guilty, people remain angry at them and often ignore the fact that as individuals, they also have the right to protect themselves in addition to being punished even though they made mistakes. In this case, the more likely that issues tackled are professor exposuring the details of unfair of his experience in competing for title of professor. He also can't get help for himself however standing on an advantage postion as a single individual on relative top power who violating another in lower position.

Recently, the issue of a professor-student scandal has caught the public's attention. The story, which initially shocked many, sparked widespread discussions, particularly among university students and individuals with similar backgrounds or experiences. This type of scandal, although tragic and dramatic, has become a focal point for many media outlets. However, in the midst of the controversy surrounding the involved individuals, there are certain overlooked aspects that deserve more attention.

First and foremost, many discussions focus on the victims directly involved in the scandal, either the professor or the student. While their suffering is evident, what often gets ignored are the other victims who are affected indirectly. The attention is overwhelmingly directed toward the primary characters, leaving out the voices of those whose rights are also violated. For instance, we rarely hear about the other students in the professor's lab who work tirelessly on experiments and papers, only to have their work stolen or overlooked. These students, who put in long hours of hard work, are left without justice, as the scandal overshadows their struggles. Similarly, we seldom consider the emotional toll on the professor’s family—his children and possibly an unaware spouse—who are also victims of the scandal, despite not being directly involved.

Moreover, in the case of graduate students, the power imbalance in the professor-student relationship often leads to unfair treatment. Many students may face challenges in securing their positions or advancing in their careers because of the professor's selfish actions. These students may not even be aware that they are being exploited or disadvantaged in the selection process for research or faculty positions. Unfortunately, their rights are rarely defended, and the system fails to hold the powerful accountable.

Another important but often overlooked issue is the professor’s own right to defend themselves. While the professor may have made mistakes, they are still entitled to a fair process, which is often neglected in public discourse. Instead, society is quick to label them as entirely guilty, ignoring the fact that they might have also been victims of an unjust system. In many cases, professors face intense pressure to conform to certain expectations or face career-ending consequences, which can lead to unethical behavior. However, once the scandal breaks, their ability to defend their rights is severely limited, as they are often portrayed as the sole perpetrator.

In conclusion, while it is important to address the wrongdoings of both the professor and the student involved in scandals, we must not forget the other victims—those whose voices are often ignored. The students whose work is exploited, the families of those involved, and even the accused professors themselves, all deserve to have their rights and experiences recognized. Society should strive to create a more balanced approach in addressing such issues, one that considers the broader context and ensures justice for all parties affected.
